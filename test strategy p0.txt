test strategy p0
	bug reporting:
		create document describing bug and its location
		project, package, module and line in module

		comment in code at location of bug with reference 
		to document or ticket location

		use a spreadsheet to list all bugs and who reported, is working on,
		severity of bug
	
	api endpoints:
		RESTful
		use flask
		Customer acctions:
			/customer
			/customer/<customer_id>
		Customer actions on accounts:
			/customer/<customer_id>/accounts
			/customer/<customer_id>/accounts/<account_id>

	best practices:
		spell out full words when naming items in code and ide
		to allow for readibility
		
		one positive test, one negative test
		
		descriptive error messages

		take short breaks periodically throughout your day.

	bug fix workflow:
		ensure all bug reports are submitted to bug folder before
		reporting via email or message or updated on spreadsheet
			-ideally different branches for bugs and fixes in repo

		ideal fix time for bugs:
			critical : 1 day or less
			medium : 3 days
			low : 1 week

		ensure all bug fixes are submitted to repo for testing before 
		reporting the fix via email or message or updated on spreadsheet
		
		ensure successful test results are submitted to repo before reporting
		bug resolution vie email or message or updated on spreadsheet
